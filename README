# Damaniel's (DOS) Dungeon Idler

An idle game with active components.

More info TBD.

## Notes about the timing loop for skills/masteries

* The game render loop will run at 30 FPS
* The core skill loop will run at 10 FPS, and action times will be set in tenths of a second (so a 6 second action takes 60 ticks)

## Interrupt handlers
The 10 FPS interrupt timer handler:
    - increment the global skill timer

The 30 FPS interrupt timer handler:
    - increment the global game timer

## Proc procedure in gmae loop
For any skill/mastery:
    - (When first started) Set the 'next proc' timer to the global skill timer + the proc rate
    - Get the global skill timer
    - If the global skill timer >= the next proc timer
        - proc the mastery
        - Set the 'next proc' timer to the global skill timer + the proc rate
        - Add the experience for this mastery to the skill exp bar
        - If the skill exp >= required XP to next skill level
            - Increment the skill level
